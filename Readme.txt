The Source is written in a way that it requires only some editing in the llviewerdisplay.cpp.
All changed are marked with ###################P373R#####################  comments.
I also included the openvr header and lib files you will need in the rar.
For informations about the rest of the files you will need, read how to compile Firestorm.
